# 2048 Game

A recreation of the game 2048.
The game consists of a 4 by 4 board of tile slots.
Begins with 2 tiles with either a value of 2 or 4 placed randomly on the board.
The user can then choose to slide the tiles up,down,left or right. 
Once the tiles are moved in the desired direction a new random block is added to the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
The goal of the game is to combine tiles with equal values to reach a tile of 2048 (or even higher) without running out of valid tile slides.
Once the game ends the user is asked to play again.
This game is coded in Python and uses Pygame for the display.
The display provides the board with tiles of different shades of gray to represent its value and the users total score of combined tiles.
